# Employee-Directory

## Description

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

Axios is a library that helps us make http requests to external resources. In our React applications we often need to retrieve data from external APIs so it can be displayed in our web pages. Axios uses methods like get() and post() that perform http GET and POST requests for retrieving or creating resources.
